# Food delivery App

This is a food delivery web-app. Built as a personal project to improve my practical skills in [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API design with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

Frontend development with
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) version 13.4,
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations and Apollo Client for data fetching with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
